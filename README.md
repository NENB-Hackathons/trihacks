# Trihacks

Trihacks, a 46 hour hacathon where we build a webside, app or bot to help with supply chain. Our team is comprized of Alvarito050506, Bigjango, Encoded, Nobody6502, and Nooz. Our idea is to make a bot that tracks what the best shipping companies are. We created Shipping Express, the fastest way to find the best shipping deals globaly. Using a python package, shippo, we are able to find three deals that might interest you for shipping. These three deals include fastest shipping, most balanced offer, and cheapest option.
